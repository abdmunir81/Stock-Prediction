## Stocks Analysis with Pandas and Scikit-Learn

The objective for this publication is to understand one way on analyzing stocks using Python Code. 

To start learning and analyzing stocks, 
1. we will start off by taking a quick look at the historical stocks prices. This will be done by extracting latest stocks data from pandas web-data reader and Yahoo Finance. 
2. Then we will try to view the data through exploratory analysis and predictions using Linear Analysis and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

## Stock Market Prediction by Recurrent Neural Network on LSTM Model

The art of forecasting stock prices has been a difficult task for many of the researchers and analysts. In fact, investors are highly interested in the research area of stock price prediction. For a good and successful investment, many investors are keen on knowing the future situation of the stock market. Good and effective prediction systems for stock market help traders, investors, and analyst by providing supportive information like the future direction of the stock market. In this work, we present a recurrent neural network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to predict stock market indices.

# Introduction
There are a lot of complicated financial indicators and also the fluctuation of the stock market is highly violent. However, as the technology is getting advanced, the opportunity to gain a steady fortune from the stock market is increased and it also helps experts to find out the most informative indicators to make a better prediction. The prediction of the market value is of great importance to help in maximizing the profit of stock option purchase while keeping the risk low. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have proved one of the most powerful models for processing sequential data. Long Short-Term memory is one of the most successful RNNs architectures. LSTM introduces the memory cell, a unit of computation that replaces traditional artificial neurons in the hidden layer of the network. With these memory cells, networks are able to effectively associate memories and input remote in time, hence suit to grasp the structure of data dynamically over time with high prediction capacity.

## Data and Preprocessing followed by model comparison
Raw Data: In this stage, the historical stock data is collected from the stock price and this historical data is used for the prediction of future stock prices.

Data Preprocessing: The pre-processing stage involves a) Data discretization: Part of data reduction but with particular importance, especially for numerical data b) Data transformation: Normalization. c) Data cleaning: Fill in missing values. d) Data integration: Integration of data files. After the dataset is transformed into a clean dataset, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets so as to evaluate.
  
 
 ## Conclusion
The popularity of stock market trading is growing rapidly, which is encouraging researchers to find out new methods for the prediction using new techniques. The forecasting technique is not only helping the researchers but it also helps investors and any person dealing with the stock market. In order to help predict the stock indices, a forecasting model with good accuracy is required.
