## Stocks Analysis with Pandas and Scikit-Learn

The objective for this publication is to understand one way on analyzing stocks using Python Code. 

To start learning and analyzing stocks, 
1. we will start off by taking a quick look at the historical stocks prices. This will be done by extracting latest stocks data from pandas web-data reader and Yahoo Finance. 
2. Then we will try to view the data through exploratory analysis and predictions using Linear Analysis and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

## Data and Preprocessing followed by model comparison
Raw Data: In this stage, the historical stock data is collected from the stock price and this historical data is used for the prediction of future stock prices.

Data Preprocessing: The pre-processing stage involves a) Data discretization: Part of data reduction but with particular importance, especially for numerical data b) Data transformation: Normalization. c) Data cleaning: Fill in missing values. d) Data integration: Integration of data files. After the dataset is transformed into a clean dataset, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets so as to evaluate.
